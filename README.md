# Prompting with CLIP
## Usage
You should use ```Colab``` (preferred) or ```Jupyter Notebook``` to use this ```CLIP_Testing_for_Image.ipynb``` file.

First, you upload an image. Then, proceed to text and change your queries continuously to get the best description for that image.

In my experiment, language problem did not cause any negative effects on text image descriptions.

## Change measure
Additionally, you can change the measure to ```correlation coefficient```, my default measure is ```cosine similarity```.
